# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hi, I am Renjie Zhu (朱 仁杰), a PhD student in Chemistry at Boston University. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from East China Normal University in 2025, where I spent four unforgettable and rewarding years. My given name shares the same Chinese characters as Di Renjie, a legendary detective figure. Therefore, I want to become a “detective” in the scientific world, using computational approaches to uncover the hidden mechanisms underlying chemical and biological systems.

	abstract = {Microtubule, a key component of the cytoskeleton, plays a crucial role in cell mitosis. Modeling and dynamic simulation of microtubules at the micrometer scale remain a significant challenge. In this study, we developed the helix-based ultra-coarse-grained (HB-UCG) model for the dynamic simulation of microtubules, based on the helical characteristics obtained from electron microscopy density data. We constructed microtubules up to 35 Î¼m in length and investigated the relationship between persistence length and contour length. By comparing our results with experimental data, we validated the potential of the HB-UCG model in simulating microtubule functions. We also simulated the twist process of microtubules driven by motor proteins, successfully demonstrating the model{\textquoteright}s effectiveness in simulating biological processes. This study can provide the foundation for theoretical simulations of microtubule functions during mitosis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
